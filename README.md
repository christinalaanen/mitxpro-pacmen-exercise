# Pacmen Exercise

The exercise demonstrates the ability to create multiple elements that behave independently and randomly as well as collision detection, using the browser window as the bounds.

## How to Run

Download the project, then open the HTML document in browser to see the pacmen generation and movement in action.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

From this starting point, I could see myself further expanding by triggering the pacman image to change when the direction is switched between right and left.

## License

This exercise was done as part of the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. The code falls under the MIT license.
